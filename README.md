# 🤖 STEM Robot Demonstration Project – Two-Wheel Mobile Robot (STM32)

This project showcases a **two-wheel mobile robot** designed for high school STEM activities. The robot is programmed to follow a predefined path with 3 S-curves and return to its starting position, demonstrating basic embedded control, motion planning, and mechatronics integration.

## 🧠 Objective

Provide partners and suppliers with:
- 📐 A full schematic design of the robot
- 📋 A detailed Bill of Materials (BOM)
- 📦 A demonstration firmware using STM32 microcontroller
- 🧭 A step-by-step programming guide using STM32CubeMX and HAL

## 📘 Overview

- 📌 **Platform:** STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill)
- 🔧 **Control Method:** DC motors with PID speed control
- 🔍 **Navigation:** IR/Reflective sensors for line following
- 🔄 **Motion Logic:** Predefined 3x S-curve + return-to-start
